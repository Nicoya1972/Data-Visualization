# Summary of Findings

Data analysis shows Victorian style houses account for 50% of the total homes in the data set. The highest priced home, an eight bedroom Victorian style, is worth $3.68 million. Victorian style houses offer the greatest square footage, the largest number of bedrooms and is the only style which offers 6,7 and 8 bedrooms. The Lodge style homes hold the lowest values, have the fewest bedrooms and smallest square footage. Data shows that home value increases with number of bedrooms. Neighborhood B contains the most houses, followed by A and lastly neighborhood C which has the fewest homes. Neighborhood B holds the most expensive homes, conversly, the most affordable home is also in Neighborhood B.  

### Data Shortcomings.

It would have been great if the data set containg age, sex and race breakdown.  Also isntead of the neighborhood being describe as a, b and c, if they were actual places.
